## Language Lab - Ruby

This repository is designated to research on the Ruby programming language and implementation of the quicksort algorithm.

## Instructions

Ruby is quite easy to install on a Linux system. I'm using WSL for the purposes of this lab.
```
sudo apt install ruby
```

Now that Ruby is installed on WSL, I can setup Visual Studio Code with the "Remote - WSL", "Ruby", and "VSCode Ruby" extensions to connect to WSL and support syntax highlighting.

It is incredibly easy to run programs in Ruby after it's installed on your system.
```
ruby <file_name>.rb
```
